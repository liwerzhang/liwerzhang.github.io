## Introduction

In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered immense interest among researchers, businesses and the common masses due to a variety of applications supported by unmanned short-haul navigation. It is quickly developing into a mature technology in several application areas, such as target search, package delivery, surveillance and rescue. Improvement of energy-efficiency of UAVs is an open area
of research which demands special attention. Optimized expenditure of battery power is a necessity since the maximum flight duration under ideal operational conditions usually last between 5-7 minutes for a centimeter-scale UAV and up to only 30 minutes for larger heavy-lift aerial vehicles. Real-time routing and navigation control are the most energy consuming tasks in most applications, closely followed by data acquisition and communication. However, a majority of researchers either assume unlimited energy capacities or do not consider the energy aspect at all while designing UAV motion planners, with the exception of a very few studies. The main stream approach to developing energy-aware motion planners recommend algorithm-based
optimization, which compute energy-efficient reference paths by optimizing suitable payoff functions of motor angular velocities and accelerations.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a highly popular method for UAV motion control and performance enhance-
ment due to its reactive approach and real-time compatibility. However, to the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, literature related to generation of minimum-energy path for UAV using DRL are very few. To address this issue, we propose a novel 3D navigation planner which is capable to compute energy-efficient and collision-free path for an UAV having partial information about its environment. We have observed that, an attention-based graph neural network performs very well in this case. Once the desired paths are generated, the UAV is driven along the desired optimal trajectories using a tracking controller.

## Methodology

The trajectory generation is a sequential process demonstrated by the following figure.

Observation received from the environment is transmitted to the RL block which conducts path planning
on a locally generated graph and generates waypoints to reach the destination using attention-based neural networks. Section of the trajectory between the two consecutive waypoints are generated online using Minimum Snap trajectory generator. After that, the trajectory tracking controller generates control inputs for following the reference trajectories.

## Experiments

The proposed RL approach can automatically search a policy with which the flight distance is
minimized as well as the energy consumption is optimized.

The following figure represents the DRL outcome which considers both distance and energy. Unlike the distance-only approach, the proposed combined reward generates trajectory that offers flexible movement along all three dimensions due to the energy minimization factor and converges faster.
