No response after initializing ray.

# Reason

Redis port 6379 ray used is already occupied.    
   
# Solve

View the redis processes via following:

```
ps -ef|grep redis 

#or

ps aux|grep redis
```

Find the pid number of processes occuping 6379 port.  

Kill them!!

```
sudo kill -9 pid #pid is the number of redis process
```

# More Info

```
ps aux | grep redis # check if redis is running

redis-server redis-conf #start redis

redis-cli shutdown #shoutdown redis
```
