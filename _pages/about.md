### About

Hi, I am Yubin Wang, a Mphil student in [Robotics][roas] with [Jun Ma][jun] at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)][hkust(gz)] and co-advised in [ECE][ece] by [Yehia Massoud][yehia] at [Innovative Technologies Laboratories][itl] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust]. 

Before that, I was a visiting student with [Meriem Laleg][meriem] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust] (now at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay][paris-scalay]). I obtained my B.Eng  in 2022 with [Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps] at [Northeastern University][neu]. I also held a position as a research intern at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].

### Research Interests

**focus on the intersection of robitics, control and learning with applications to planning and decision-making for autonomous systems**.

**current topics -  motion planning for autonomous vehicles via combining deep learning and  conventional control strategies.**
