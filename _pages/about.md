### About

Hi, I am Yubin Wang, a Mphil Student in [Robotics][roas] at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)][hkust(gz)]. 

Before that, I was a Visiting Student at [Innovative Technologies Laboratories][itl] advised by [Yehia Massoud][itl] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust] and jointly advised by [Meriem Laleg][meriem] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust] and [Université Paris-Saclay][paris-scalay]. I obtained my B.Eng in Automation in 2022 from [Northeastern University][neu] with [Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps]. I also held a position as a research intern at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].

### Research Interests

**focus on the intersection of robitics, control and learning with applications to planning and decision-making for autonomous systems**.

**current topics -  motion planning for autonomous vehicles via combining DeepRL with conventional control strategies.**
