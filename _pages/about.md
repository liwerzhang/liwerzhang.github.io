### About

Hi, I am Yubin Wang, a Mphil Student in [Robotics][roas] at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)][hkust(gz)] and also a Visiting Student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece] advised by [Yehia Massoud][itl] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust].

I also hold a position as a research intern at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].

I obtained my B.Eng in Automation in 2022 from [Northeastern University][neu] with [Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps].

### Research Interests

**focus on the intersection of robitics, control and learning**.

**current topics -  motion planning for autonomous vehicles via combining DeepRL with conventional control strategies, and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf] epsecially multi-agent informative path planning.**
