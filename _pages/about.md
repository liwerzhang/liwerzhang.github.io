### About

Hi. I am Yubin Wang, a Visiting Student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece] advised by Prof.[Yehia Massoud][itl] and co-advised by [Prof.Meriem][meriem] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust].    

I also hold a research position as a intern working in [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Prof.Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].          
          
I will join the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou][hkust(gz)] as Red Bird Mphil Student working with [Prof. Jun Ma][junma] this fall.

I will obtain my B.Eng in Automation in Jun. 2022 at [Northeastern University][neu]. I also worked closely with [Prof. Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps] at [Northeastern University][neu] in China.




### Research Interests 
**focus on the intersection of control, robitics and learning**.     

**current topics -  RL-based UAV decision-making considering energy consumption, and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf] epsecially multi-agent informative path planning.**
