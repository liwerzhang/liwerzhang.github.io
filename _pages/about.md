I am a first-year MPhil student in [Robotics][roas] with [Jun Ma][jun] at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)][hkust(gz)], and co-advised in [ECE][ece] by [Yehia Massoud][yehia]  at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust]. 

Previously, I spent several years as a visiting student with [Meriem Laleg][meriem] at [KAUST][kaust] (now at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay][paris-scalay]). I also worked at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].

My research covers the intersection of robitics, control and learning with applications to planning and decision-making for autonomous systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles and robots.
