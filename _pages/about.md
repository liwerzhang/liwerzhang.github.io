### About

Hi, I am Yubin Wang, a Mphil Student in Robotics at [HKUST(GZ)][hkust(gz)] and a Visiting Student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece] advised by [Prof.Yehia Massoud][itl].    

I also hold a research position as a research intern working in [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Prof.Guillaume Sartoretti][gui] at [National University of Singapore][nus].          

I obtained my B.Eng in Automation in Jun. 2022 from [Northeastern University][neu] where worked closely with [Prof.Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps].

### Research Interests 
**focus on the intersection of robitics, control and learning**.     

**current topics -  UAV decision-making with energy constraints via DeepRL, and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf] epsecially multi-agent informative path planning.**
