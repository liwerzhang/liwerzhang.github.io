### About

Hi, I am Liwen Zhang, a Master Student in Control Engineering advised by [Linying Xiang][linying] and [Fei Chen][fei] from [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries][saps] at [Northeastern Univeristy][neu].    

I also hold a research collaboration position at [Innovative Technologies Laboratories][itl] with [Yehia Massoud][yehia] at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology][kaust].          

I obtained my B.Eng in Automation in Jun. 2020 from [Qingdao University of Technology][qtech].

### Research Interests 
**focus on the multi-agent systems and networked systems control, especially for graph theory and complex networks**.     

**current topics -  the relationship of fragility and responseness of boolean networks via graph theory and reinforcement learning.**
